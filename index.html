    <p> Hello awesome people!!! First I want to say I am pretty excited to make this page finally… and I can’t wait to add my digital work, photos, and videos. 
 So a little about me; I started riding in spring 2015, and a lot has happened during my experience riding motorcycles. I had my longest ride, which was about 354 miles, a car hit me. Even though I was injured it doesn’t stop me from riding. 
I made this site so I can share my adventures with people and friends who want to check up on me.  I won’t be doing video blogs … unless people do want to hear me not know the lyrics of songs.
I am excited to do this!  I have stalled because I didn’t have enough material, but now I do. I hope you guys will enjoy my work or I hope to see you one the road. </p>
